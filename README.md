## Orgin of "Polo"

> Polo is a 2D side-scrolling video game platforming game developed by Revolve Media. In the game, the player takes the role of a little block dude. The main goal of the game is fighting your way through various different worlds. The game was first released as an open beta. The full version is still being refined, but includes unlimited play.
Its a platformer that was born in early 2008 and has been a ongoing project ever since. The original intention of Polo was to be a platformer and to venture around the world, collecting coins, killing weird monsters and learning the story behind the game. Sadly, however, Polo was never finished.

While this game may not properly compile within Gamemaker:studio due to depreciated fucntions, The original (first revision) of the game is still [available to download](https://drraccoon.me/files/Polo1.6.3helms.zip).
